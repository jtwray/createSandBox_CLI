# README.md for CLI App with Animated SVG Background

The CLI app, created with Node.js, elbow grease, and a dash of mental cobwebs, facilitates a seamless process for users. Simply paste a GitHub repo URL, and the app opens it in a new window within a Codesandbox.io development environment.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the CLI app: `node app.js`

## 🌐 How It Works

The app leverages Node.js and elbow grease to process user input. Upon pasting a GitHub repo URL, it dynamically generates a link to open the repo in Codesandbox.io.
A new window is opened at the new link. Voila.
